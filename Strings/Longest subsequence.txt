The approach makes a LCS table which computed the LCS of two given strings using the concepts of Dynamic Programming. 

- The LCS table is of size nxm, where n and m are sizes of respective strings.
- The first LCS row and column are filled trivilly (Fill 0 until the common element comes, after which fill 1)
- For position table[i][j], 
    - table[i][j] = table[i-1][j-1] + 1; //If str1[i] equals str2[j].
    - table[i][j] = greater(table[i-1][j],table[i][j-1]); //Otherwise    
- table[n-1][m-1] is the size of the required LCS.


To reverse engineer the LCS,
- Start at table[n-1][m-1] corner.
- If str1[i] equals str2[j], it is present in the LCS. Print the element in stack and move diaginally upwards to table[i-1][j-1].
- If unequal, move left or top depending upon which is greater.
- Slide along the edges. (Boundary condition)
- Procedure ends when either the top-left block is reached, or the value 0 is encountered in the table.

Flaunt your faster algo to your friends, when one day you all decide to find LCS of two strings, instead of playing PUBG or CS:GO.
